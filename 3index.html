<h1>Journal - ICD20</h1>

<p>I recently completed a project where I built my computer, which was a rewarding and educational experience as I learnt how much it costs to own a high-performance computer. I also created a birthday card for Mr. J using CMU. In the last CSE classes, we started working on individual tasks with our Raspberry Pi devices. We connected and set up their own Raspberry Pi and computer. It was fascinating to see the various games and designs that my classmates created, showcasing their unique tasks and creativity.
    We then began working on project K8. We spent one day assembling K8 and then dedicated a few days to learning how to control it using various commands. Additionally, we designed the K8 box to prepare it for a battle royale event. During the class participation in the battle royale, my group had some difficulties with the steering, which made it challenging to control K8 and attack other groupsâ€™ balloons.
    Throughout the week, we also spent time developing our website. After briefly doing unit 3 of the CMU unit, we switched to a new task on CodeHS. We spent several consecutive days working through the units on CodeHS, continuously learning new concepts and skills. In between our coding activities, we spent a day pulling weeds and transporting the dirt and weeds into the forest behind the school. We have just started working on the RST, marking the beginning of a new phase in our class.
