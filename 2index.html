<p>A startup called Lapse allows smartphone users to take pictures with their phones. The only problem with that is it takes time for the picture to be fully developed and you also need a chance to edit the photo or retake it. Lapse is becoming more popular with millions of users, 100 million photos are captured each month and are in the top-10 ranking for the U.S. app store for photographic apps. They now have funding of $30 million to help improve their app. Greylock was an early backer of Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok and Linkedin. They co-led with DSt Global Partners. They were also previous backers GV, Octopus Ventures and Speedinvest also participated. They got a $12.4 million raised in seed and pre-seed funding in 2021, which is a total of over $42 million and a valuation of around $150 million. People have said the companyâ€™s ethos has an old-school feel on how their app operates.

<p>Computer basics
The first computers were used for numerical calculations. However as any information can be primarily encoded, their capacity to handle large amounts of data has extended the range and accuracy of weather forecasting. Their speed has allowed them to make decisions about routing telephone connections through a network and to control mechanical systems such as automobiles, nuclear reactors, and robotics. Computers also have limitations, some of which are theoretical. For example, there are undecidable propositions whose truth cannot be determined within a given set of rules, such as the logical structure of a computer. </p>
<p>Digital computers In contrast to analog computers, digital computers represent information in discrete form, generally as sequences of 0s and 1s (binary digits, or bits). The modern era of digital computers began in the late 1930s and early 1940s in the United States, Britain, and Germany. The first devices used switches operated by electromagnets (relays). Their programs were stored on punched paper tape or cards, and they had limited internal data storage.</p>

<p> Robotics <p>
<p> Robotics is a branch of engineering focused on designing, building, and operating robots, which are machines that perform tasks typically done by humans. These robots do not have to look like people, though some are designed to appear human to make people feel more comfortable around them, even if some find them creepy. Robots come in many forms and serve various functions in different industries.
There are many types of robots, each tailored to specific tasks. In healthcare, robots assist in surgeries, help with physical therapy, and deliver supplies in hospitals. Home robots, like the Roomba, clean and can perform other household tasks. In manufacturing, robots handle tasks such as welding and packaging. Logistics robots manage warehouse operations and deliveries, while space exploration robots, like those on Mars, explore distant worlds. The military uses robots for dangerous jobs, such as bomb disposal and carrying equipment. Robots also serve in entertainment, travel, and more, with advancements continuously expanding their roles and capabilities. 
There are advantages and disadvantages, such as the ability to work in hazardous environments, robotics increase productivity, and they also ensure a better quality of work. Robots can repetitively perform tasks mistakeless while not losing boredom. The disadvantages, robotics requires an excessive amount of money just as a startup costs, robots will start to take away jobs and robots also need companies to hire more skilled staff to be able to control and program the robot. Robots require programmers, operators, and repair personnel making it a big cost and a lot of work. </p>
